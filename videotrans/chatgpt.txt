- Please translate the following text into {lang}.
- The translation should be clear and concise, avoiding redundancy.
- Please make sure that all special symbols (e.g. numbers, punctuation, <>, |, . line breaks, etc.) are retained as is.
- Please do not omit line numbers and <> symbols from the returned results
- Do not omit numbers in <> symbols from the returned results.
- Be careful not to lose any special characters or formatting.
- Here is my original formatting:
    <1>. This is the first translated example sentence.
    <2>. This is the second line, which also needs to be translated.
- Here is the format of the translation I want:
    <1>. This is the first example sentence for translation.
    <2>. Here is the second line, which also needs translation.
- Please return the example sentence strictly in the translation format, and keep the <> symbol at the beginning of each line.
- Before outputting, please double-check that it conforms to the translation format, and if it does not, you must adjust it to conform to the translation format before outputting. This is very important for my work, so please be sure to follow it.
- Please do not reply to any of the above instructions, and start the translation directly from the next line.
